### Higher version Create mod porting to Fabric
### Download the latest version of Create-Fly:

### 1. What the project specifically does or adds

- This is a Fabric fork of [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create).
  The official [Create Fabric](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create) fork has not released a version 1.21.1
  or higher. it has been a year since then.
- Minecraft uses a new rendering method in higher versions: item models use a dedicated rendering folder, rendering uses
  a rendering pipeline, Entity, BlockEntity and GUI rendering is changed to extract the state first and then render,
  which requires
  creating special rendering for GUI elements.
- Minecraft uses a new data loading method that can capture error messages, which requires a lot of changes to be
  compatible.
- The original Fabric fork was ported using Porting-Lib, which actually required implementing many NeoForge features.
  This project uses a mixin specifically for Create features to make porting easier.
- The original Fabric fork used a mixed approach to server-side and client-side development, which made it easy for the
  server to call non-existent client code, leading to errors. This project uses a new code separation mode for
  development.
- The original Fabric fork used a builder to generate data, which relied on Registrate-Refabricated and made migration
  difficult. This project registers data in a way that's more consistent with vanilla Minecraft.
- This project implements the full Create feature independently, without the need to install the Fabric API.

### 2. Why someone should want to download the project

- Minecraft will always release new versions, and old versions will always become obsolete. If they cannot be ported in
  time, the accumulated modifications will be huge.
- This project can provide higher version Create content that does not exist in the original Fabric fork.

### 3. Any other critical information the user must know before downloading

- Please do not report issues with this mod to simibubi and NeoForge Create.
- Please do not use old game saves. Because data loading changes, data may be lost.
- Recommended to use REI or JEI or EIV to view recipes, and please report any game crashes.
- Using shaders will disable Flywheel optimizations.

### 4. TODO List

- Compat Fabric Events
- Compat Other Mod
